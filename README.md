# Optimizing rice disease classification: A comparative study of different color, shape and texture features

## Overview
![GraphicalAbstract/GraphicalAbstract.png](GraphicalAbstract/GraphicalAbstract.png)

Rice, often considered the staple of life in the Philippines, plays an integral role in the country's culture and sustenance. With a staggering domestic consumption of 16.5 million metric tons of milled rice in 2023, the reliance on this crop is undeniable. However, global rice production faces significant challenges from diseases which can cause yield losses of up to 70%, particularly when they strike early in the crop's life cycle. Effective rice disease management, therefore, relies heavily on early classification and forecasting systems that enable strategic interventions to minimize yield losses, reduce environmental impacts, and support sustainable agriculture. The integration of image processing and machine-driven systems is emerging as a vital solution to address the challenges of accurate disease classification.

This project introduces a novel and efficient approach for classifying 13 rice diseases, as compared to the usual 2-3 diseases focused by local and international studies, by analyzing entire images without requiring complex pre-processing and segmentation steps. By leveraging global image features, including color, shape, and texture, the study trained SVM and ANN models, achieving classification accuracies of **86.23%** and **83.93%**, respectively. 

The detailed dataset, methodology, and results will be discussed in the following sections.
